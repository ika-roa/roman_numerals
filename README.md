# Roman Numerals Kata

> TDD / OOP implementation of the Roman Numerals Kata

## General requirements:
- Write a function that converts normal numbers in Roman numerals. 
- The upper limit up to which the function should work is 3999.

## Important:
- Follow TDD best practices:
    - Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
    - Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
    - Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.
- Make code really beautiful and highly readable.

## Additional requirements
- Implement reverse function as well: roman to normal integer
- Make code object-oriented
- Implement addition and subtraction methods
